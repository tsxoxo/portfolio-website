## Intro

If you know what you want and you want to jump right in, **[skip to the steps](#steps)**.

/observation -- i've 3 parts:

-   a guide
-   an intro to utopia
-   maybe, my story/musings

so it could be the other way around: if u wanna learn about Utopia, skip to there?

## What is Utopia?

[Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) is a tool to help with [responsive design](xxx). On the website, You plug in certain parameters and let it generate CSS that makes your text and spacings adjust to the user's viewport size.

Instead of media queries, it uses a 'fluid' approach to a problem we web designers face every day (every day I live in a society).

To me, it scratched that consistency itch that only a design system can scratch. It took some time in the beginning, but it's pretty satisfying to see this website be all responsive and shit.

### Where to start

I found these resources helpful in explaining the general concept:

-   ü§è Play with an [interactive demo](https://utopia.fyi/) to get a sense of the result.
-   üëÅüëÅ Watch an [intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDuGtN-GakA) by the creators (18 minutes).
-   üìú, üëÅüëÅ Read an [intro article](https://utopia.fyi/blog/designing-with-fluid-type-scales/) and look at a diagram illustrating the idea.
-   üìú Read a [longer intro article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/designing-developing-fluid-type-space-scales/) that also explains the context of the larger problem.
-   ü§è, üìú, üëÅüëÅ Play with the official [Figma starter project](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1122903924123950023), read the succinct intro on the 'readme' page, and look at multiple illustrations.

### In a nutshell

Quotes from official resources showing the essence of the Utopia approach:

> 1. Define a type scale for a small screen
> 2. Define a type scale for a large screen
> 3. Tell the browser to interpolate between the two scales, based on the current viewport width

<cite>[source](https://utopia.fyi/blog/designing-with-fluid-type-scales/)</cite>

> I designed these [min and max], maths designed this [everything in between]

<cite>source same as above</cite>

> (...) we only need to visualise the smallest and largest states, which we call @min and @max. Everything in between will be displayed according to the rules we set.

<cite>[source](https://utopia.fyi/blog/designing-a-utopian-layout-grid/)</cite>

> (...) fluidly interpolating between two modular scales, one for smaller screens, and one for larger screens

<cite>[source](https://utopia.fyi/blog/css-modular-scales/)</cite>

### Dictionary of the Utopia UI

These are the terms used in the UI of the Utopia website.

**`min`**\
The smallest state You feel like visualising in your design. The `font size` will never go smaller as the one for `min`.

**`max`**\
The largest state You feel like visualising in your design. The `font size` will never go bigger as the one for `max`.

**`width`**\
The `min` and `max` states are defined in terms of their widths (so you can almost think of them as viewports).

**`font size`**\
The size of the majority of text in your project (sometimes referred to as 'body text'). Serves as the base step for your `type scale`. Choosing the `font size` is often done early in the design process.

**`type scale`**\
The ratio used to create a [modular type scale](https://utopia.fyi/blog/css-modular-scales), with `font size` being the base step. This can sound exotic, but it's really just a way to let math help You come up with a palette of font sizes. (So You don't have to ask yourself: _"should my h1 be 48px or 49px?"_)

## Guide

### Prerequisites

-   For the developing part You should know how to use a code editor and possibly the command line to manage your project. Possible starting point: [Beginner's Guide to Eleventy \[Part II\]](https://www.tatianamac.com/posts/beginner-eleventy-tutorial-partii) on Tatiana Mac's blog.

-   For the designing part You should know the basics of Figma, especially auto-layout. Possible starting point: [Figma's get started area](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002051613-Get-started).

-   You should know how Utopia works. Possible starting point: one of the resources I list in the [intro to Utopia section](xxx what is utopia).

-   You should have a project with Tailwind CSS set up. Can be a fresh one, can be an existing one you want to give the old redesign.

### Steps

Disclaimer: this is one workflow among many.

#### Other ways

[2 other guides](#the-other-guides) helped me come up with this workflow (meaning I stole a lot from them). They focus on parts of the whole while I'm trying to go from start to finish. But that also makes them shorter, which is what You might want.

#### Create a wireframe

**The goal: Figure out the size of the the majority of text in your project.** To this end, it would probably help to get a sense of the rest of the project. Here's a rough sequence of steps You might take:

-   focus on either `min` or `max`.

-   Choose a width.

What width should You choose?
-- Whatever is appropiate for your project.
No hard answers here. You're gonna hear this a lot.

I read on [their blog](https://utopia.fyi/blog/designing-a-utopian-layout-grid/): _"(...) it makes sense to design the @min screens as small as is practically possible"_. And that made sense to me.

They go on to explain: basically, 320px is a small yet tested size. For a long time, phones used to be this wide. And y'all were doing _fine_. So the Utopia creators chose this width as a reasonale starting point for a modern design. I take it as a value meaning _somewhere at the smaller end of the viewport spectrum where I can still read longer texts comfortably without getting annoyed_.

For designing this site, I left the defaults -- `min`: 320px, `max`: 1024px. Because I had enough things to worry about.

But it's all about what You want to achieve and who You're designing for.

-   In Figma, create a frame with that width.

Tip: To make a frame with proportions close to an actual screen, You can choose a device from the list that has a width close to your `min` (press `f` in Figma), then scale it proportionally to the right width (hold `shift` while scaling).

-   Design stuff until You get a sense for a workable `font size`.

Don't put too much pressure on yourself. Rather, start accepting that You'll be re-making and re-deciding this again. -- Later after generating your type- and spacing-scales You'll do a Utopia redesign of this wireframe -- consistently applying your scales and maybe even using a Utopia grid.

#### Create the other wireframe

Go through the same steps, but focusing on the other state.

At the end, You should have 2 widths and 2 font sizes figured out (for now).

#### Run the Utopia plugin and apply some text styles to your design

This can help with figuring out your type scales, as it saves some copy-pasting.  
It gives You Figma styles and components representing all the building blocks of the Utopia design system -- the type scales, the spacing palettes and the grids. You'll see.

1. Learn the basics by reading either the description page of [the plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/951884648789524000/Utopia-%2F-Fluid-type-%2B-space-calculator) or the dedicated [intro article](https://utopia.fyi/blog/get-started-with-utopia-figma-plugins/).

2. Go to Figma and run it.

/fix step order 2. Click on the big button. Possibly, wait for a bit until it finishes working -- it sometimes would take like 20 seconds for me. It's doing a lot of good work. Don't worry about your `type scales` yet, just run it once to see what it does. You'll focus on them in the next section.

3. Find the generated output somewhere on the canvas -- it's a big bunch of frames. Look at everything. If a bunch of stuff looks blank, try making the the grid visible in Figma by pressing `shit + g`. Feel free to frame the bunch or wrap it in a section. Put it somewhere where you can easily take a peek at it while you're designing. I was peeking pretty often. (Aside: Haven't seen the phenomenon of a 'strong' text variant that's got a bold font weight talked about anywhere else in the Utopia ecosystem. But it's there. I've certainly used it. I actually modified some of the font-weights for my purposes. A system is just the beginning.)

4. Apply the appropiate generated style to your body text. At the time of writing this is called `U/Type/Min/Prose/Step 0`.

5. Do the same thing with a heading or two. Add some to your design if You hadn't already and apply some styles to them. There is some guesswork here, as You may or may not know how many steps You need for your scale. I went minimal and chose 3 steps but now that I write a blog and need like 5 heading hierarchies, I'm reconsidering.

6. Now you should have at least 2 Utopian text styles living in your design. Change the font family of all of these in one swoop by using [this other plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/979005485047252094/Utopia-%2F-Batch-update-text-styles) by the Utopia creators. (The text should change on the main-frame as well as in your designs.) You can undo with `cmd-z` if You want, but it's good that You know that this is easy to do.

7. Run the Utopia plugin again, just with a different type scale. Observe how your headings change, but your body text stays the same. You'll be running it again, a few times.

These plugins can be your tools and trusty helpers. You can also get there by copy-pasting between the Utopia website and Figma. I liked the plugins. For such a messy, sprawling thing as a design system generator and a batch-updator I found them to be very friendly.

/Aside:
Now here might be a good case to use the new variables feature in Figma. put all of these values there and you dont have to look them up. you could even map min and max to their own modes. could be interesting. i was ready to do that but unfortunately figma restricts free accounts to 1 mode only. I feel this might be a good moment to link to my 'buy me a coffee (or Figma subscription)' thingy. I pledge that if I get 15 bucks, I'll buy a month of Figma and write a guide on doing this with variables.

#### Figure out a `type scale`

1. Focus on either `min` or `max`.

2. Make sure You have a few different types of text in your wireframe. By now You should have at least some body text and a heading. This is a good time to flesh out your design and put in more -- other headings or smaller text -- so that You can see how a particular type scale will harmonize across your design.

3. Apply appropiate text styles to whatever text in your wireframe, like You did in the previous section. Maybe with a clearer sense of how many steps You need in your scale.

4. Go to either the Utopia website or the Figma plugin. Generate a scale with some ratio. See how it fits into your design. -- if you're using the plugin just look at your magically updated wireframesand; or, if you're using the website copy-paste some values into Figma to get a sense. Rinse and repeat until You find one that fits your needs.

5. Do the same thing for the other threshold, trying out different scales. For an explanation why You'd want two different scales, see the top of [this article](https://utopia.fyi/blog/designing-with-fluid-type-scales/).

This one's especially iterative (messy) because there are so many moving parts. It's a whole scale of things, after all. Many moving parts can overwhelm a brain like mine, so I gave it a hand and simplified the process.

Here's where I found myself some weeks ago:

While designing my landing page, I got obsessed with my big chunky hero-heading because who doesn't. I wanted it to stay on a single line. So I made it as big as possible and paid attention to the font size. And I decided to build my type scale around this piece of text.

That's the simplification. It gave me something to go on: I knew I wanted a scale with a font size pretty close to what I had given my hero-heading. And since this was to be the biggest heading on the page, I knew this size had to be several steps up the ladder, since I needed room for my smaller headings.

So I knew what to look for in a scale and wasn't just blindly dating one after the other. (It seems so much of design is about giving yourself limitations to make the wild chaos of life barely managable.)

It was still a lot of messing around. How many heading-hierarchies do I need for this site? Do I maybe wanna skip a scale-step between adjacent headings (so that my `h1` sticks out even more from my `h2s`, for example). I want to live boldly, so how bold do I want my headings to be?

I settled these questions for myself. I was content. Then I decided to add a blog to my site. Which means more headings, which means my scale no longer accomodates my content. Every day, I redesign. Or, as they say:

> ["A digital product is never finished"](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/designing-developing-fluid-type-space-scales/)

#### Figure out a spacing palette

/mb first instructions, then resources? mb give steps after all? mb structure this more: there are 3 ways i see to work with spacing...
/ I think a step or two should be good

Ahh, spacing. Where we go to breathe, and nuts and bolts go to party. The little nooks and cranies that gather dust in our hearts and minds and our kitchens. The cracks where the light shines in. etc. etc.

There are no steps here, since I didn't mess around too much with this. I took the default spacing palette and added some custom space pairs, that's it. All in all, I felt a decent balance between constraint and freedom. For this website, it worked alright.

Instead of instructions, here's 3 ways to work with a Utopia spacing palette in Figma.

With all of these, consider **using auto-layout** whenever You can. For me, this helped keep things simple: everything is in the gaps and paddings. No pesky margins whatsoever. It's also straightforward to implement later using grid and flexbox.

1. Just do it by hand

When I asked myself _"do I really need to remember the spacing values and type them by hand at every single decision?"_, my answer was _"yes, yes I do"_. Needless to say, I was peeking at that generated master-board regularly.

It wasn't too bad. Some of You with more than two braincells might use those extra ones to start remembering your spacing palettes after a while.

2. Use variables

For my fellow 2-cellers, Figma let's You set up a spacing palette with variables pretty easily now:

[xxx](screenshot of variables set up)

I don't see how to make these sync when You re-generate your palette, tho.

**But**... there might be a way... Follow me into this dark alley, friend.

3. Use the spacing-components from the Utopia plugin

See these little squares on the master-frame? You can literally just [drag them into your design](https://utopia.fyi/images/utopia-plugin-10.jpg). And when You're sick of them, just close your eyes, press `shift + g` 3 times and they'll go away. How does that work, You ask? _They're actually just, like, pieces of the grid, man!_ Clever, clever, these Utopia designers. Now You select the variant You want from a drop-down menu and there's your spacing: 2xs, m, 3xl -- all your favourite t-shirt sizes!

You can use these squares for your gaps, your paddings, your margins, you can put them under your sofa and forget about them for 7 years. They'll stay there, patiently waiting until it's time to implement. Or move.

They are cursed with a terrible curse tho.

But they come with a frozen yoghurt! I call it _"froyo"_!

EXTRA
If You want to try out different spacing palettes, You might go through a similiar loop as when You were figuring out the type scale: first, apply the spacing styles from your system to your design (by copy-pasting, or using variables, or if You see another way, please let me know!(xxx)), then run the plugin again. You might wanna work with variables even more. I wanna use variables after trying it out while writing this. I was really peeking a lot at that master-board.

The Utopia folks have written two articles dealing with spacing. [designing with a fluid space palette](https://utopia.fyi/blog/designing-with-a-fluid-space-palette/) introduces the concept, makes a case for having a design system in the first place and also has a demo to play with. [Painting with a fluid space palette](https://utopia.fyi/blog/painting-with-a-fluid-space-palette/) is more hands-on giving you CSS snippets while explaining the concepts. Choose according to your inclination.

#### Decide if You want to use a baseline grid

It can make You feel extra special. The Utopia plugin generates one. There is an issue that needs to be solved, but nothing to nasty. If You're already special, move on to the next step. If yes -- You need that extra dose of special -- I recommend You read [Designing a Utopian layout grid](https://utopia.fyi/blog/designing-a-utopian-layout-grid/). There's diagrams and a step-by-step guide and You'll get to know some of the messy decisions that have to be made if You're going down this path. After that, maybe You'll see the grids in the Utopia main-frame with slightly different eyes. Feel free to re-run the plug-in and adjust the grid _to your needs_&trade;.

#### Re-make your design the Utopia way

aka bringing it all together

Since I left some room for experimentation during the previous steps, You might have already re-designed your wireframes using the Utopia system. If so, congratulations, You're done with the hard part and can start implementing!

For all the others, it's time now to port your initial design and make everything Utopian!

-   Setup: Generate a system using the Utopia plugin. If using the website, it might help to make styles out of your type and spacing scales.

-   Create a fresh set of frames for `min` and `max` to house your upcoming redesign. If You're not using a grid, do exactly what You did when You were creating your frames in the beginning. You can move on to the next step. Run along, summer child! If You _are_ using a grid, the issue is now how to fit the grid into the frame -- do you stretch **it**, or the frame, or leave it kind of overlapping or what? The solution proposed in the grid guide mentioned earlier is simple: make your `min` frame the size of your `min` grid. It won't be exactly your official `min` width, but it should be close to it. Nobody will ever know. Simple but devious. buaha!

-   Design your project using the generated system. You know how to handle text, you have 3 ways of handling spacing. You have a grid or you don't. Go out there and make some mistakes!

#### Iterate

You might want to get things right at this stage. This saves some work later on.

#### Implement

-   Get the CSS custom properties out of your system and into your config. Go to the Utopia website, plug in the values You used with the Figma plugin (they're on the first generated frame) and copy the CSS output into your project.

You have some options here. Chris Penrod does it one way(xxx resources). I go an extra step and put my variables into a `base.css` file which I then reference in `tailwind.config.cjs`. My reason for doing it like this is that I can easily copy and paste Utopia's output wholesale into `base.css` whenever I iterate (aka change my mind), which, I know I will.

This is what it looks like:

```css
/* üëá base.css --- some values ommitted for brevity */

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

:root {
	/* type */
	--step--1: clamp(0.75rem, calc(0.65rem + 0.52vw), 1.06rem);
	--step-0: clamp(1rem, calc(0.83rem + 0.83vw), 1.5rem);

	/* spacing */
	--space-3xs: clamp(0.25rem, calc(0.21rem + 0.21vw), 0.38rem);
	--space-2xs: clamp(0.5rem, calc(0.42rem + 0.42vw), 0.75rem);

	/* spacing one-up pairs */
	--space-3xs-2xs: clamp(0.25rem, calc(0.08rem + 0.83vw), 0.75rem);
	--space-2xs-xs: clamp(0.5rem, calc(0.29rem + 1.04vw), 1.13rem);

	/* spacing custom pairs */
	--space-s-l: clamp(1rem, calc(0.33rem + 3.33vw), 3rem);
	--space-xl-m: clamp(2.25rem, calc(3.25rem + -1.25vw), 3rem);
}
```

```js
// üëátailwind.config.cjs --- some values ommitted for brevity*/

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
	theme: {
		extend: {
			fontSize: {
				'fl-sm': 'var(--step--1)',
				'fl-base': 'var(--step-0)'
			},
			spacing: {
				'space-fl-3xs': 'var(--space-3xs)',
				'space-fl-2xs': 'var(--space-2xs)'
			}
		}
	}
}
```

/ improve code:

-   change space-fl to simply fl?
-   unify lg - l ?

The `fl` stands for `fluid`, I took it from Chris.

With this setup, new classes should show up in your IDE's autocomplete: try typing `p-spa` somewhere as a class and pressing your `autocomplete` shortcut (I have it on `ctrl + space` in VSCode). You should see a list of all the fluid padding values. Same for any other spacing category like `gap`, `spacing` and `margin`. Same for font sizes.

Now, if You're starting a fresh project, You are ready to code it with entirely fluid spacing and typography!

#### If you're redesigning an existing project

-   replace static values with fluid ones

I wrote a regex for finding most (but not all) of the standard Tailwind spacing classes, mostly to keep my regex muscles from atrophying.

`[\s"']([mp]|gap|space)-?\w?-\d`

To use this, paste it into the searchbar where you search through all your files at once (`cmd + shift + f` in VSCode). For it to work, You might have to turn on regex (there's a little button that says `.*` on the right of the searchbar itself in VSCode).

Without this, You would have to type in each padding-variation (pt, pb, p-, px-, py) and do the same for margin, etc.

## WTF

### My confusion

/alt titles
onboarding rant

It took me a while to wrap my head around Utopia. Meaning that I sat confused in front of their UI for a while, then read like 6 of their blog articles, then watched their intro video. Then I did my civic duty and complained in their youtube comments that their system could be more accessible to newcomers.

I don't necessarily find the concept super hard (especially once I got it, hehe), but it was a mystery for me how to actually use this system -- where do I start? What's `font size` stand for in the Utopia UI? Ok, it spit out some CSS, but can I design with this in Figma (without it being super cumbersome)?

In the end I found a way (I think, fingers crossed ü§ûüèº). But it was by grasping on to straws -- part of [a workflow laid in a blog post](https://utopia.fyi/blog/designing-a-utopian-layout-grid/), a plugin found on Figma, another blog showing how to implement it with Tailwind(xxx). I would have loved a little something a little more comprehensive, more hands-on, bringing it all together. That's my story.

But who knows -- maybe You wouldn't be reading this guide if this author hadn't gone through an initial period of confusion and frustration. I bet that's the driving force behind at least half of the tutorial industry. I'm gonna show them how to be welcoming to beginners. Gonna show them all.

### My story

NOTE
A section to frame and waffle

Some if not all of the steps are just me following this [kind-of-guide from the Utopia blog](https://utopia.fyi/blog/designing-a-utopian-layout-grid/). It was an especially exciting read for me because it acknowledges that designing is a messy process. Second guessing your desicions is part of it, even for experienced designers. I love it when I hear competent people, in whatever field, talk from that place where it becomes clear that competency is a fragile concept. We're all winging it, making mistakes and then trying to do better mistakes.

### Who is writing this?

I build websites and write tutorials. [Hire me!](xxx)

I've used Utopia to redesign this website and ran into enough roadblocks to make me want to save other people the same frustrations.

While working on this very site I ran down the rabbit hole of how to make text responsive. I found utopia, I think through [Kevin Powell], and it looked fun enough to try. And by fun I mean it scratched that consistency itch that makes me want to look at my CSS and see only 8 values in total.

## Outro

### Why such a guide

Hope you enjoyed, learned, or killed some time!

I haven't found many guides like this while I was redesigning my site. Utopia doesn't seem like rocket science now that I know how it works, but it did take me several hours to get a grip on all the concepts and figure out a way how to actually work with them.

I kind of fear that they intentionally didn't give basic how-to instructions. Because they're experiences designers and they know things lose they're purpose if they're simplified in this form. Designing is a messy business. Let's keep it that way.

What I hope is to get my name out there, to maybe get some feedback on this workflow, and to maybe get a person or two into design systems, because they can be pretty cool.

I could have used a few more step-by-step instructions like this. But I don't know. Anyway, if this saves even one person from eternal damnation, I'd be pretty satisfied. some time or frustration.

### Disclaimers and goodbye

This is one workflow of many. It might be embarrassingly simplistic to some. It got the job done for me.

I'm on Twitter (xxx twitter). Let me know your utopian workflows. Give some feedback. Say hi, for goodness' sake, don't be shy! And especially, let me know if you got stuck, peeved or if you want more!

Thank You, my wonderful editors!

## Resources

### The other guides

-   [Tailwind CSS Responsive Design Without Breakpoints](https://christianpenrod.com/blog/tailwindcss-responsive-design-without-breakpoints/) by Christian Penrod also shows a way to implement the Utopia system in Tailwind. The way I do it in this guide builds on his approach. His guide is also much less verbose than what You're reading here. Much less verbose. Thank You, Christian. You helped me realize that this is possible and possible without too much hassle.

-   [Designing a Utopian layout grid](https://utopia.fyi/blog/designing-a-utopian-layout-grid/) by James Gilyead from the Utopia team goes only through part of the process, but that was already immensely helpful to me. Even more important, it acknowledges that the design process is messy and full of questions that only You can answer.

### Utopia stuff

-   [Meet Utopia: Designing And Building With Fluid Type And Space Scales](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/designing-developing-fluid-type-space-scales/) by the Utopia creators gives you a pretty nice all-around introduction: it lays out the problem, gives some historical context, talks about how the idea came together and lays out the resulting system, even hinting at a workflow here and there.

-   [The official guide to the Utopia Figma plugins](https://utopia.fyi/blog/get-started-with-utopia-figma-plugins/) does what it says.

-   [The official starter project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1122903924123950023).

### Utopia-Tailwind integrations

I found two plugins that were made to help with integrating Utopia into Tailwind. Neither worked out-of-the-box for me and I wasn't in the mood for hacking.

-   [cwsdigital/tailwind-utopia](https://github.com/cwsdigital/tailwind-utopia)
-   [domchristie/tailwind-utopia](https://github.com/domchristie/tailwind-utopia). This one's a fork of the `cwsdigital` one but has a different API.

### Fluid design more generally

-   See [TailwindCSS: Fluid typography with CSS Clamp](https://davidhellmann.com/blog/development/tailwindcss-fluid-typography-with-css-clamp#home) if You want to skip Utopia and do more of the heavy lifting yourself

-   In [Linearly Scale font-size with CSS clamp() Based on the Viewport](https://css-tricks.com/linearly-scale-font-size-with-css-clamp-based-on-the-viewport/) Pedro Rodriguez goes deep into `clamp` and interpolation and brings you along for the ride.

### Limitations

-   In [Responsive Type and Zoom](https://adrianroselli.com/2019/12/responsive-type-and-zoom.html) Adrian Roselli warns against using `clamp` because of issues with zooming.

-   In [Fluid Type](https://elisehe.in/2021/03/13/fluid-type) Elise Hein talks about some fundamental questions in a very approachable way. Why do we care about fluid type in the first place? And is clamp really so great?

-   [x] skim utopia blog -- steal phrasing to explain, collect links to specific topics, take general notes
-   [x] work on intro: more personable, move what will i learn before wtf?
-   [x] fix: extra space before links wtf
-   [x] write some steps
-   [x] look at review and depen in notion
-   [x] mention official demo gif
-   [x] make links open in new tab -- no because let the user decide how they open links
-   [x] revise: shorten utopia-basics section; rewrite/break up 'big idea'
-   [x] fix: make it so I can have spaces between list items in markdown without them going haywire in html
-   [x] test this: \* is this a possible alternative? -- instead of using the utopia website to generate type scales and manually copy-pasting them into figma, use the utopia figma plugin?

**formatting**

-   set apart steps and musings/my stories
    -   different font styles
    -   dividing lines
    -   backgrounds / boxes
    -   :::asides
    -   foldable content
-   give 'skip to the steps'-link extra special styling

_... formatting that maybe requires dealing with markdown plugins_

-   wrap each chapter in a `\<section\>`
-   make 'dictionary of utopia UI' a dd-dt list?
-   improve blockquote - cite, e.g. give blockquote the attribute
-   make directives like `tip` to break up the flow of the text

**UX**

-   try and be rigorous about not repeating links, except when linking to different sections of the same document
-   make sure link texts stay consistent and clear. for inspiration, see the section [Structure link text](https://developers.google.com/style/link-text#structure-link-text) in the Google Developers Style Guide

**structure**

-   i got a thing going in the spacing section: 1. intro 2. official resources 3. talk about the thing -- maybe update the other section to point to official resources as well? then in the Utopia intro i could say 'you can look at this and this to get a general idea. Also, I'll be pointing out relevant resources at the start of each section' -- hmm, do I like this idea?

**IDEAS**

-   add content: make own demo gif?
-   IDEA: make each step of the guide formatted like _succinct instructions (1 paragraph) --- detailed explanation and musings_. this could be visually reinforced by making the instructions stick out more than the musings (e.g. higher contrast), or even by hiding the explanation in a foldable element (use `<dt>`?)
-   IDEA: broaden scope -- talk about design systems; about different approaches to responsive design (or link to resources)
-   IDEA: separate steps from my specific case

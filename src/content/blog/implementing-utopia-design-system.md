You'll learn how to build a website with the wonderful [utopia design system](https://utopia.fyi/) using its fluid scale generator, Figma and Tailwind CSS.

## Who is this for?

People who want to use the [utopia design system](https://utopia.fyi/) and want a step-by-step guide. People like me who both design and code. People obsessed with visual consistency.

## Who is writing this?

I build websites and write tutorials. [Hire me!](xxx)

## Guide

### Prerequisites

-   For developing the project: Basic knowledge of the command line and a code editor. You can find a beginner-friendly guide on [xxxx blog]()
-   A basic knowledge of Figma and a free account
-   A basic knowledge of utopia: what it does, what the base font size represents. see here for an explanation(xxx)
-   A project with tailwind CSS set up. Can be empty, can be an existing one.
-   ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

### Steps

-   Sketch a design to figure out the base font size for min and max
-   Go to utopia and play with the type scale (you will likely iterate on this - aka realize it doesnt work, slap your forehead (optional) and do it again. in short: there's no need to get it perfect the first time)
-   go to figma and run the utopia plugin with the values from the previous step (you can also just copy the url into the plugin) wait for lke 20 seconds until it finishes working. find the generated output somewhere on the canvas. frame it. place it close to where you're working. i was looking at it pretty often.
-   now here might be a good case to use the new variables feature in Figma. put all of these values there and you dont have to look them up. you could even map min and max to their own modes. could be interesting. i was ready to do that but unfortunately figma restricts free accounts to 1 mode only. if you sponsor me, id be happy to do this and add to the guide!
-   keep designing. if you set up your variables, use those. If you didn't then simply keep every font size and every spacing value within the system
-   i forget where i read this but the idea was to use grid and flexbox as much as possible. so that most of your frames in figma will be governed by auto layout and most of the spacing decisions will refer to gaps and padding values within these frames. later these will easily translate to flexbox and grid layouts.
-   the folks at utopia have made another useful plugin to use when you want to change the type face. It changes the font styles in multiple layers, perfect if you want to update your existing master-frame.
-   When you're happy with your design system, go to `utopia.fyi` and copy the output into your project. I copied mine into a `base.css` file and then referenced the variables in `tailwind.config.cjs`. A good reason for doing it like that is that I can easily copy and paste utopia's output into `base.css` again and again, however often I want to iterate. So now you should have something like

```css
/* üëá base.css --- some values ommitted for brevity */

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

:root {
	/* type */
	--step--1: clamp(0.75rem, calc(0.65rem + 0.52vw), 1.06rem);
	--step-0: clamp(1rem, calc(0.83rem + 0.83vw), 1.5rem);

	/* spacing */
	--space-3xs: clamp(0.25rem, calc(0.21rem + 0.21vw), 0.38rem);
	--space-2xs: clamp(0.5rem, calc(0.42rem + 0.42vw), 0.75rem);

	/* spacing one-up pairs */
	--space-3xs-2xs: clamp(0.25rem, calc(0.08rem + 0.83vw), 0.75rem);
	--space-2xs-xs: clamp(0.5rem, calc(0.29rem + 1.04vw), 1.13rem);

	/* spacing custom pairs */
	--space-s-l: clamp(1rem, calc(0.33rem + 3.33vw), 3rem);
	--space-xl-m: clamp(2.25rem, calc(3.25rem + -1.25vw), 3rem);
}
```

and then in your Tailwind config

```js
// üëátailwind.config.cjs --- some values ommitted for brevity*/

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
	theme: {
		extend: {
			fontSize: {
				'fl-sm': 'var(--step--1)',
				'fl-base': 'var(--step-0)'
			},
			spacing: {
				'space-fl-3xs': 'var(--space-3xs)',
				'space-fl-2xs': 'var(--space-2xs)'
			}
		}
	}
}
```

-   Find and replace static values with fluid ones: search through all your files to find all the static values for spacings and text sizes. instead of typing in each padding (pt, pb, p-, px-, py)and doing the same for margin, etc., I wrote this regex that covers a lot (but not all) cases:
    `[\s"']([mp]|gap|space)-?\w?-\d`

(this relies on the fact that my fluid class names begin with a letter while those of tailwind begin with a digit (that‚Äôs the ‚Äú\d‚Äù in the above regular expression))

## wtf

If You looked at utopia and find it fascinating but a little hard to grasp, then You're like me. I had to read several articles on their blog to get a good picture. For me it wasn't a thing of just diving in, even though the UI looks fairly simple.

Here's some questions I had in the beginning and some answers I found:

-   "what's root font size? what's type sale? why are there two screens"
-   --- then reading a bunch of articles and learning that: the root font size tends to represent the body text; the type scale represents an algorithmic palette of font sizes which tends to differ on each screen; and this is about interpolation, hence two screen sizes

-   make links open in new tab

### extra copy

You'll go through a workflow of using utopia's fluid scale generator to set up a design system, setting it up so you can work with it in Figma and then implementing it with tailwind CSS.

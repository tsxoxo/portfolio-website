## TODO

### Make it deploy after upgrading to Astro 5

[] Speed up build time

-- [x] Use precompiled Python: mise WARN no precompiled python found for 3.13.2, force mise to use a precompiled version with `mise settings set python.compile false`

-- [] Try to understand what Python does in the building process
[] Look at last failed build and start from there
-- [] Migrate properly from Tailwind 3 to 4

### Meta

[] Look at ESLint. Research style guides. Start [here](<[url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd-gBxzcsdA)>)

### Update

[] Utopia + Tailwind post for Tailwind 4 after migrating site

### Write post about 7GUIs cell project

[] Themes: Testing-what test make sense; how do you model an app like this with xstate; why do these challenges have so few states?

[] Style: <Card> for Blogpost. Include name of series

### Design

[] Redesign first glimpse: probably graphic instead of photo

[] Redesign projects: make them into case studies and describe the process more

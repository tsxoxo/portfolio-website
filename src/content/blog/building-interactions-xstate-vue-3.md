## extra copy

I see behavioral patterns within this story that I've seen before. It's clear that I would have caught this bug way earlier if I was building tests with each feature. That much is obvious. And that would have saved me considerable confusion. And still -- I feel reluctant to learn testing now: it feels like such an aside.

Always this tension: do I use this project to learn (thus taking exponentially more time) or do I get this done fast? So far, I've been taking a two-pronged approach in my work: I simultaneously do a LOT of research before choosing a library, and don't take the time to really LEARN a topic. That's not really true, but that's how it feels right now.

Even earlier, there was a similar issue with the code I inherited from my chosen template. There's some things that are deprecated by now. I could rewrite them, but... I shudder and shout _no!_. Because deep down, I want to code as little as possible. What I wanna do is... is... is... make music. There, I said it.

## Focus, damn it!

I think I need to bring this back to its stated purpose: basically, I want to have a nice looking thing for my portfolio.

I need a win. I wanna animate something, dammit.

It feels like I've lost myself in the details here. I'm kind of exhausted after working on this bug for however many hours.

It's a bit difficult moving on from this bug, tho. The question now is: is there even a solution to my problem within Xstate or do I need to switch my tech stack here?

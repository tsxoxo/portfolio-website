## TODO
### Make it deploy after upgrading to Astro 5
[] Speed up build time
-- [] Use precompiled Python: mise WARN  no precompiled python found for 3.13.2, force mise to use a precompiled version with `mise settings set python.compile false`
-- [] Try to understand what Python does in the building process
[] Look at last failed build and start from there

### Write post about 7GUIs cell project
[] Themes: Testing-what test make sense; how do you model an app like this with xstate; why do these challenges have so few states?
[] Style: <Card> for Blogpost. Include name of series

### Design
[] Redesign first glimpse: probably graphic instead of photo
[] Redesign projects: make them into case studies and describe the process more
